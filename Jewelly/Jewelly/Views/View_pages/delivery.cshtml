            <span>
                Orders may be subject to security checks, which can cause delays in the processing of orders. We may need to
                contact you to carry out these security checks – if we are unable to reach you using the contact details
                provided it will delay the despatch of your order.

                Parcels will need to be signed for in person. Please ensure the delivery address is an address where you will be
                at the time of delivery (home or work). If someone is not present at the time of delivery, our courier company
                will leave a calling card and you will be able to reschedule your delivery for a more convenient time.

                Parcels with a business address chosen will be delivered to the designated delivery place at the chosen business
                address, not directly to the recipient.

                To check on the status of an order or verify delivery, please call <strong class="link">
